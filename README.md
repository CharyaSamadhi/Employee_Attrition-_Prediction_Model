## 📌 Project Description
Employee attrition (or employee turnover) is a major challenge faced by companies. By predicting which employees are likely to leave, organizations can take early action to improve retention.

In this project, we:
- Collected an **HR dataset** of employees.  
- Performed **data cleaning and preprocessing**.  
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns.  
- Trained multiple **machine learning models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).  
- Selected the **best performing model** and deployed it using **Streamlit**.
